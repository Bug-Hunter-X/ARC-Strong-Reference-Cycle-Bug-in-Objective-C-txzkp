In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object ownership and memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Specifically, strong reference cycles can easily occur if you're not careful with property declarations and relationships between objects.

For instance:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong) AnotherClass *anotherObject;
@end

@interface AnotherClass : NSObject
@property (strong) MyClass *myObject;
@end

// In implementation files:
@implementation MyClass
// ...
@end

@implementation AnotherClass
// ...
@end
```

In this scenario, `MyClass` has a strong reference to `AnotherClass`, and vice-versa. If these objects hold onto each other, neither will ever be deallocated, resulting in a memory leak.
